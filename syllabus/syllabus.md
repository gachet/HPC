**Introduction:**

As engineers we often encounter problems too large or too difficult to solve in a conventional manner; therefore, we resort to using the computer to do the hard work for us. These types of problems include problems in computational mechanics, optimization, and statistical analysis. Sometimes, these problems can become so large that the computational expense overwhelms our desktop workstations and we seek out high-performance computing (HPC) resources or HPC clusters to perform the job. These HPC machines are almost always computers that run a UNIX/Linux style operating system and include different parallelization paradigms such as MPI, OpenMPI, OpenCL, CUDA, etc. This course will introduce the student to the UNIX environment in a scientific computing context and include instruction on several import UNIX applications that will make them more productive users. We will also cover, at an introductory level, the differences between these parallelization styles of computing and develop a basic working understanding of how to utilize the application programming interfaces (APIs) in scientific applications.

Additional topics if time allows: Other scientific languages: Fortran, C, C++, Numerical Libraries: PETSc, FEA tools: Cubit, DAKOTA


**Grading:**

 * Codecademy course completion - 10%
    * This grade will be given entirely based on completing the assigned modules on time.
 * Video lecture quizzes - 20%
    * 10% for on time completion
    * 10% for correct answers
 * In-class exercises - 20%
    * These will be exercises performed on the computer, in-class, with the guidance of the instructor. Additional out-of-class time may be required to finish exercises not completed in-class.
 * Assigned projects - 50%
    * These will be longer exercises that may be started or worked on in-class, but will require out-of-class time to complete.

**Disability Statement:** The University of Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities.
